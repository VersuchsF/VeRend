# VeRend
###### *Name: VersuchsF(My nickname) + Renderer = VeRend*
3D Render Engine
Created for the purpose of learning 3D graphics

## Prelude
This is my second, more conscious attempt of making render engine.

This engine will contain rendering with OpenGL and Vulkan with simple implementation of other game engine features (Physics, Sound etc.).

I don't plan to support this project long-term, much less bring it to any *production* usable state.
This is just a basic render engine, to help understand how it works. 
However, if you'd like to use it for learning or as the basis for your own engine, I'd be very happy :3

## Gettings Started
Any C\C++ compiler with C++ 20 support

CMake 3.10+

### Dependencies
SDL3 3.4.2 https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL

GLM 1.0.3 https://github.com/g-truc/glm

GLAD2 (OpenGL 4.6 Core) https://gen.glad.sh/

## Road map
vaerion 1.0.0:
* 0.1.0:
  * Window creation
  * Logger
  * OpenGL initialisation
* 0.2.0: 
  * OpenGL basics
  * Shaders
  * Textures

*...soon...*

version 2.0.0 *(Very much for the future)*: 
* Vulkan support.
